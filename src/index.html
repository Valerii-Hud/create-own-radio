            With just a click or a tap, listeners can access a diverse array of
            music, talk shows, news, and podcasts from around the globe. Unlike
            traditional radio, online radio offers a virtually limitless

            Whether you're into pop, rock, jazz, classical, or any other genre
            or even podcasts, there's an online radio station for you. Online
            radio also provides opportunities for independent artists and niche
            genres to reach a wider audience
          </p>

          <p class="info__text">
            Furthermore, the convenience of online radio cannot be overstated.
            It's accessible anytime, anywhere, whether you're at home, work, or
            on the go. With mobile apps and streaming services, listeners can
            enjoy their favorite stations on smartphones, tablets, or computers
            with an internet connection
